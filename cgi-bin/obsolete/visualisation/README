Perl scripts are in cgi_bin/, java jar files and html files are in java/

In the perl scripts, the values that need customising are 
$data_path
$docroot
$cache_path

$docroot is straight from the web server configuration file.
$data_path does not require the trailing slash.
Observed data files are then assumed to be in $data_path/observed.
Modelled data files are in $data_path/gcm/$gcm/ eg. "/home/htdocs/gcm/gfdl-r15/"

Raw data generated by the cgi scripts are cached in 
$docroot$cache_path/observed/ or $docroot$cache_path/$gcm/, 
eg. /home/htdocs/ipcc_ddc/visualisation/cache/observed/ or /home/htdocs/ipcc_ddc/visualisation/cache/cgcm1

The cache will need to be cleared out periodically or it will take a large amount of disk space.
A script clearcache.sh is included, but must be customised before use.

The html documents need to be customised by changing the appropriate parameters to the applets.
They are self explanatory but need to point to the cgi scripts, the cache, and the map image.
The "datapath" parameter should point to a script alias for the location of the cgi scripts. 
The script alias is set up in the web server configuration file eg.
ScriptAlias /ipcc_cgi "/home/htdocs/package/ipcc_ddc/cgi-bin"

with a corresponding directory entry eg.
<Directory /home/htdocs/package/ipcc_ddc/cgi-bin>
    Options ExecCGI
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>
