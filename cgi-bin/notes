xsl include directive does not appear to work (not compiled according to error message),
need to figure out how to either do the includes in python, or simply copy into the xsl file


downl:  cleared up, better checking: still has a logical flow issue, and multiple use cases which
are not clearly defined (i.e. with cookie, without cookie, resetting inof in a dud cookie, first pass,
second pass:: check again on Mnday, when cookies cleared)


can then move downl_form into downl as an option, with a form processing class.


extracting data from a point: would be good to be able to bundle a few things into a single csv.
Not clear how to package this into existing "downl" structure. May need to move away from putting all
info in the filename: <model>.latxx_lonxx.csv
If time series are only available as all timeperiods, all scenarios, this will be simplified.
Alternatively, <nmodel>_<etc>.latxx-xx_lonxx-xx.csv, could be a section.


does bare bones csv -- need to add metadata, and ideally clean up ddc_navx.


appears to be no data for first model: this was a bug in the catalogue generator make_cat_nav.py, for lev=1: now fixed.


Need to explain latitude, longitude
e.g. AXES in DATA field, amd 1st col, lat, 1st row,long somewhere
check format spec. again.


would like to work out why restful path (below) partially works: it loads the page, but links don't work.
