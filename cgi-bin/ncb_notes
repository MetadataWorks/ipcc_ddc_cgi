ncb etc: browse netcdf: need to include a form to, at first, select month.
         also, add axes to table in ncbv and stylise table.

         axes added, ncbv reasonably clean.
         need an export to csv, respecting Sam's format.




         need something like Numeric.sum(  data[sl], axis=iax )


         nav now provides a way of navigating around the dataset.
         does not include observational data.
         uses cataloguing information generated by make_cat.py and stored in a compact form.
         
         Currently uses some unfriendly labels.

         Should provide some means of switching between files once a variable has been selected: this would mean a slight modification of the present selection fields. Ideally would check where a variable is available. Structure is getting a little messy.
