We have a substantial collection of data files which can, in princple be identified by a set of
identifiers: dataset, model, scenario, variable, ensemble number, format, time period.

Can this be presented in a way which does not expose a specific heirarchy?

Practicalities: 
(1) Suppose a user is presented with all the options for all the above N categories. He selects an element from one category, and gets new lists of options which are still available for N-1 categories, plus some information relevant to his selection. 


cgi -- input:
field=value

(1) evaluate number of fields selected.
(2) get navigation data from appropriate catalogue
(3) generate page with options to select unseleted fields or unselect selected
fields.



currently, don't have a means of preserving region selection data while
navigating around file criterea: the latter work as links, and do not post the 
in form information. Could either set a cookie or put in URL. latter would get
messy.


two display modes can be switched, but not recorded as yet. COuld standardise
some stuff between them,


The "point" display option keeps latitude nearly fixed when moving between
models, but other options deal with array indicies.
Also done for longitude, needs to be implemented in domain.


Need to add some links to help. Have started a categories.txt file in
ancillary. This could be implement as links from table headings. There should
also be some info on individual models in /wrk etc.
